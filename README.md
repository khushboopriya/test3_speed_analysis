# test3_speed_analysis
APPROACH/STEPS:
1. I have analysed and cleaned the data , since there were no null values so no further steps were needed.
2. Then I have created a new column speed_exceeded for drivers who have exceeded the speed and for those who haven't.
3. Some more features have been added like what part of day was that, the speed of drivers was how much slower or faster than the 
speed limit.
4. Then the data was visualized and different conclusions were drawn, for the whole data.
   I have drawn conclusions for what part of day had more drivers crossing the speed limit, which state have more bad drivers,
   which functional class had more bad drivers, whether speed was crossed more on highways or anywhere else.
   
   Then after deriving month from the timestamp, I have performed time series(monthly) analysis of each functional class and , each state
   and etc.
   
The different patterns found are noted and showed in the jupyter notebook.
